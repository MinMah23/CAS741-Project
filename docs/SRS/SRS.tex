\section{Introduction}

The Inverted pendulum is a classical control problem used for illustrating non-linear control techniques. The system is motivated by applications such as control of rockets and anti-seismic control of buildings.The inverted pendulum system consists of a pendulum which is attached to a cart that can move horizontally. It is unstable because its center of mass is above its pivot point so without additional help will fall over.The cart move horizontally by an external. This force is the only control input to the system. By manipulating the force, the position of pendulum is to be controlled.\\
Considering the force, we would like to simulate the behaviour of the system and measure the position and the angle of the pendulum in the presence of the force.
The following section provides an overview of Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for a pole-cart system. This section explains the purpose of the document, the scope of requirements, the characteristic of the intended reader, and the organization of a document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

The main purpose of this document is to describe the mathematical model of IP system. To clarify software requirements, detailed information about goals, assumptions, theoretical models, and definitions will be explained.\\
Therefore, this document will be the reference during producing the software. It will provide  requirements of the software which will be used in
planing for design stage.
The following SRS document will remain abstract exploring what is being solved rather than how it will be solved.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The problem is restricted to two dimensions. The pendulum is attached to the cart in such a way that it is free to rotate in the pivot. The cart can move horizontally,left or right. for more details, see the assumptions section  (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt})
 
\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
Intended Reader(s) or Reviewer(s) should have knowledge about equations of motion in Physics. Good understanding of solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in Mathematics is also needed. Both of the topics are offered in the undergrad engineering courses or high school Mathematics and Physics subjects.


\subsection{Organization of Document}

The organization of the document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by \cite{article1} The template will present the system's goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. Goals are good points to start. To be familiar with mathematical model, Section~\ref{sec_theoretical} and then Section~\ref{sec_theoretical}, Section~\ref{sec_gendef}, Section~\ref{sec_instance} can be explored.
Readers interested in top-down reading can begin by reading the system's goal statements (Section~\ref{Sec_gs}). Subsequently, the theoretical models will elaborate on the goal statements. Lastly, readers can finish with a more  understanding of the system by reading instance models of the system.

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  

\subsection{System Context}


\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{systemcontext.jpg}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The interaction between the product and the user is through a user interface. The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide required inputs including cart and pole features.
\end{itemize}
\item The Inverted Pendulum simulation software Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure all inputs are in correct format and detect data type mismatch.
\item Calculate and show the outputs.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The end user of the Inverted Pendulum simulation software should have an understanding of undergraduate Calculus and Physics.

\subsection{System Constraints}

There are no system constraints for this project.

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally the instance models.

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}
The inverted pendulum system inherently has two equilibrium points, one of which is stable while the other is unstable. The stable equilibrium corresponds to a state in which the pendulum is pointing downwards. In the absence of any
control force, the system will naturally return to this state. The unstable equilibrium corresponds to a state in which the pendulum points strictly upwards and thus requires a control force to maintain this position.\\

The Inverted Pendulum simulation tool is intended to describe and simulate the behaviour of the system in the presence of different inputs. As the inverted pendulum is widely used as a benchmark to demonstrate concepts and test control strategies and algorithms in nonlinear control, the final tool can show system status and be a great help as an educational material for students and engineers.


\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Inverted Pendulum: An inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It is unstable and without additional help will fall over.}

\item {Force equilibrium: A body is in force equilibrium if the sum of all the forces acting on the body is zero.}

\item{Friction: The force that resists the sliding or rolling of one solid object over another.}

\item{ Moment: The turning effect of a force is called the moment. The moment is the result of the force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the pivot or point where the object will turn.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}
  
The physical system of IP simulation Tool, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig_physys},
includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item{PS1: The cart}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}


\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical
system. The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model
[T], general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or
likely change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_systemdimension}:]
The system is a two-degree of freedom system, so the pendulum is allowed to rotate in a two-dimensional plane.
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_pendfrictionl}:]
The pendulum is smooth and friction-less.
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_pendulumInertia}:]
The pendulum is unified and its moment of inertia is constant.
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_cosTheta}:]
The equations of the problem are non linear equations and to make them linear, we can assume that $\theta$ is small enough to have, $\cos(\theta)$$ is equal to $1.
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_sinTheta}:]
According to previous assumption, for small angle of $\theta$, $\sin(\theta)$ is equal to $\theta$.\\
\end{itemize}

The acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the mass of an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is decreased.}  \\

%\subsubsection*{Derivation of ...}

%\plt{The derivation shows how the IM is derived from the TMs/GDs.  In cases
 % where the derivation cannot be described under the Description field, it will
  %be necessary to include this subsection.}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\section{Requirements}

This section provides the functional requirements, and the business tasks that the
IP simulation software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] 
{Provide input values.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_OutputInputs}:] {Calculate horizontal position of the cart form \iref{Findx}}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:] {Calculate the angular position of the pendulum from \iref{FindTehta}}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}
The nonfunctional requirements are listed below:
\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  {Accuracy: The accuracy of the computed solutions should meet the level needed for engineering or scientific application and have the properties described in Section \ref{sec_CorrectSolution}.}
 
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] 
{Usability: The properties of the software should be able to tested easily through verification and validation plan (VnV Plan).}
 

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
{Maintainability: The effort required to make any of the likely    changes listed for IP simulation software should be less than 50\% of the original development time.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
{Portability:  IP simulation software can be run on all of the
    possible operating environments, such as Windows, Mac-OS, and Linux.} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Likely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] 
{The software may be changed to consider friction of the pendulum [\aref{A_pendfrictionl} ]}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] 
{The software may be changed to consider non- linear equations and all values of the angle ot the pendulum [\aref{A_cosTheta}],[\aref{A_sinTheta}]}


\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[ULC1\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:]
{The system has two-degree of freedom [\aref{A_systemdimension}].}

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other.Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on the assumptions.Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other.
